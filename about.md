I am a Software Engineer based in Dallas Texas. My wife, Hina, is the most amazing woman. Our dog, Simba, is the boss.

I enjoy reading history, philosophy, biographies, science, business books, and sometimes fiction. I enjoy blogging about what I read or do. Photography is my childhood hobby. Other things I enjoy are painting, hiking, meditation, video games, deep movies, music, guitar.
