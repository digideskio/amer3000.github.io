Here is my setup:
	
  1. [Secure Shell](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo/reviews) - for accessing server and commiting code,
  1. [ShiftEdit](https://shiftedit.net/) - probably the best and simplest web based PHP editor,
  1. [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) - for free private repos.
