<blockquote>
But I was still the same person. No one even realized I had a Rolex-- or cared-- except for one creepy guy at a party who also had one.

That was one of many reminders in my life that you can't buy your way into being someone interesting. Even if we ooh and aah over someone's new car or gadget, our subconscious isn't fooled. Deep down we know that purchases don't define us, despite advertisers' promises.
