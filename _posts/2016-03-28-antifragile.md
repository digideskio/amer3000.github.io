[Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile) was my introduction to Nassim Taleb. A lot of people had recommended this book to me but I could not find time to read it until now. Well I didn't really read it but listened to it. I finally signed up for Audible. I was never a big fan of audiobooks but they make sense on long treadmill runs or while stuck in traffic. But I have a feeling Nassim Taleb won't approve of audiobooks. He would probably say that a book should be read with full attention to it not while navigating traffic.

Antifragile is anything, object, individual, or system, that benefits from disorder or stress. The easiest example is muscles in body. Another example might artist since controversy usually end up with more sales for artist.

One thing that bothered me a bit was Nassim Taleb dissing highly educated people. He believes that higher education & highly educated people are just sham. Done only for meaningless abbreviations after name. The real breakthroughs in knowledge, technology, and science come from doers who are trying to solve real problems. On some levels, I agree with him but on other levels  I feel doers cannot make progress without progress in theoretical knowledge by Sheldon Coopers.

Overall, definitely a good book. It will challenge, if not change, some viewpoints. It is worth every minute spent reading it (or listening to it).
