_I translated this poem in my freshman year for my English class:_


This is a world of miracles for you.  
But for me, this is the world of chances.

The world of fantasies is poor,  
But poorer is the world of births and deaths.

It is no wonder that your gaze will change it all,  
The world of possibilities is calling you.
