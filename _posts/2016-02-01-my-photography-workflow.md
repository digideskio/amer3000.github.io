Last year, I was using Smugmug. But then I decided against it and share my photos more causally like on Flickr and Facebook.

Also I have simplified my workflow a lot.

## Folder Structure
I am using simple YEAR/DATE structure. With so many photos, it is incredibly hard to categorize them. 

## Import &amp; Delete
Right after import, I delete bad photos. Sometimes, that is as much as 75% of imported batch.

## Edit &amp; Delete
In next round, I perform basic edits, mostly correcting white balance and adjusting colors. In this round, I also create panaromas, merge photos to clean up scenes, or create HDRs, if any.
And then I delete any bad photos that I missed during my first round. I also delete all but one copy of similar photos.

## Share on Flickr
If there are any images that I want to share, I create a new album through Lightroom on Flickr. Add photos that I want to share to the new album. Also add keywords and descriptions. Then I simply press **Publish**.

One thing I like about using Lightroom with Flickr is that if I ever notice an issue with a photo, I can edit it in Lightroom and simply republish it. 

## Share on Facebook
Lightroom can publish to Facebook initially but cannot update photos once published. So you have to delete the photos on Facebook and then re-upload from Lightroom.

So after upload is done, I simply delete the newly created album from Lightroom. This way list of albums under Facebook in Lightroom catalog remains small.
