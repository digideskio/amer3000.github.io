I signed up on a few microstock sites hoping recoup some of cost of my camera. These sites provide FTP access for easy uploading photos. Lightroom doesn't come with an easy way to publish or export photos to FTP site.

But [Lightroom SDK](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/photoshoplightroom.html) comes with a free sample plugin that can export photos to a FTP site. It works really well and very easy to install. I learned this at [LightroomSolutions.com](http://lightroomsolutions.com/ftp-directly-from-lightroom/).
