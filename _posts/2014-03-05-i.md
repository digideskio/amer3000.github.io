Who is that is I  
Still lost in my mind  
Trying to find my purpose  
When there might not be one  
The first thing was writing  
Can words truly change anything?  
Why should I write  
When there is so much noise  
Are you in that house  
or are you out here  
I will give up now  
This desert is just too vast  
My voice will not reach you  
Is this even a language  
What is music when there is no rhythm  
Why should I write  
When I have nothing to say.
