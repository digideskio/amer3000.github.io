**Slow motion workout**

The technical term is 5/5 Cadence (5 seconds up, 5 seconds down). I tried this for the first time on Sunday, it is really intense. Momentum is not there to help you. You will feel every part of your muscle throughout the motion. 

**Weights to workout with**

Tim Ferris showed a simple formula to figure out what should be the starting weight to workout with. Simply do regular sets. If you can do 5 rep, wait a minute &amp; then increase the weight by 10lb or 10%. When you fail a set, then take 70% of last 5 rep set and use that weight for slow motion workout. You can figure out weights to use by trial and error. This shouldÂ prevent injuries or wasted time.

The other part of choosing weights is to monitor progress. Every time to you finish a set with 7 reps, next time increase weight by 10% or 10lb.

**Rest Days**

I never knew importance of rest days until I read it in this book. Basically, your muscle grow during rest period. I used to workout everyday &amp; not really gain any muscle. 

**Cat Vomit abs workout**

You basically exhale as deeply as you can, hold for 10 seconds and then inhale. Repeat 10 times. 

**Do not drink calories**

Not drinking calories is easy. Sweet stuff is disgusting anyways.

**Bike Shed Effect**

This is one of the best advice in the book. Basically, if you say you are building a nuclear power plant, no will tell you how to build it. If you tell them, you are building a bike shed, everyone will tell you how to do it even if they never build it.

Same thing happen when working out &amp; eating healthy. Everyone thinks they know the best way of eating &amp; working out. Ignore them.
