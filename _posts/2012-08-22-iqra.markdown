<blockquote>According to The New York Times, Steve Jobs had an "inexhaustible interest" in William Blake; **Nike founder Phil Knight so reveres his library that in it you have to take off your shoes and bow;** and Harman Industries founder Sidney Harman called poets "the original systems thinkers," quoting freely from Shakespeare and Tennyson. In Passion &amp; Purpose, David Gergen notes that Carlyle Group founder David Rubenstein reads dozens of books each week.
