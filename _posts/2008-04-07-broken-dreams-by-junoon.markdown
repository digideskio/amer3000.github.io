*This is one of my favorite song by [Junoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junoon_(band)). I am not sure if I translated this or copied from somewhere. [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=As+I+turn+back%2C+my+eyes+dampen&oq=As+I+turn+back%2C+my+eyes+dampen&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=93&ie=UTF-8#es_sm=93&espv=210&q=%22As+I+turn+back%2C+my+eyes+dampen%22) shows only my site.*


As I turn back, my eyes dampen  
When I realized my incomplete life

My life became clear to me  
Broken promises  
Deserted dreams  
Broken promises  
Seek time's tender shade

Yesterday too, was in ruins  
Now is deserted as well  
Life asks for a moment of support

Damp memories  
Won't let me sleep due to grief  
Damp memories  
Won't let me live.
