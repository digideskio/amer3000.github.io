You are neither for this earth nor for that sky.  
The world is for you; you are not for the world.

This garden is the place for pain and prayer.  
Not for picking flowers or for building a nest.

How long will you stay in the Ravi, Nile, and Farat?  
Your ship was built for endless oceans.

It was nothing, what we have made it.  
We made it more, just for our fantasies.
