I first heard of [Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharmeen_Obaid-Chinoy) while watching Oscars this year. She made two Oscar winning short documentaries, [Saving Face](http://savingfacefilm.com/) and [A Girl in the River](http://sharmeenobaidfilms.com/portfolio_page/girl-in-the-river-the-price-of-forgiveness/). Both of these movies seem about disturbing issues that Pakistani women face.  I plan to watch these movies, but still haven't gathered enough courage to even play trailers, especially for Saving Face.

We need more poeple like Sharmeen in Pakistan. Because of *A Girl in the River*, Pakistan is closing the legal loopholes that allow Honor Killings of girls.
