People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But thats not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. Im actually as proud of the things we havent done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying "no" to 1,000 things.
