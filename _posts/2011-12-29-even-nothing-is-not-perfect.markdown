They say "nothing is perfect". Obviously, they are saying perfection is impossible. But sometimes, I tend to imagine out in space, away from all galaxies, there must be a spot where there is absolute nothing or perfect vacuum. Hence, creating a perfect nothingness.

Unfortunately, [perfect vacuum is not possible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_state). There are [virtual particles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluctuation#Virtual_particles_in_vacua), and [other particles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body_radiation).

So even nothing is not perfect.
