Other day on TV, I saw some archaeologist digging up dinosaur bones. It looked so much fun, they are out in sun, in mud, discovering lost history. Archaeologist has to be the best job in the world. Of course, my childhood heroes were all archaeologists, Indiana Jones, Lara Croft. So I might be a bit biased.

Other cool professions, I think, are photographer and writer.

As a photographer, you work when you want, where you want. Not all type of photographers have this freedom. But a travel/adventure photographer can do it.

And as a writer, you can also work when &amp; where you want. Write in a coffee shop, on beach, in pool, while camping. You don't even need anything more advanced than pen &amp; paper. You can always type it later or have someone else do it for you.
