[The Part Time Photographer](http://parttimephoto.com/start-here-your-ptp-cheat-sheet/) is my new favorite blog. I have been reading it on and off for a while. It has given me a lot of ideas and encouragement. As photography gear is on expensive side, I always wanted to do a little professional photography to pay for it. But mostly been afraid about how it would impact my free time.

After reading The Part Time Photographer blog for over a year, I finally decided to fill out the email signup box. But I was surprised to see him personally reply to my email. The personal encouragement from him actually pushed me to finally put up an ad on Craigslist. We will see how that goes.

If you are interested in starting photography business, I recommend that you start with this blog.
