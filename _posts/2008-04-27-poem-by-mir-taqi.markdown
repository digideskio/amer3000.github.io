A sad poem by [Mir Taqi:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_Taqi_Mir)

Stop crying, this is just the beginning of love.  
Hold on and see what will be next.

In the morning, voices were in the caravan.  
Let's move on and let the sleeper sleep.

On this ground nothing can grow.  
Please stop planting seeds of wishes in your heart.

These are marks of true love, they remain forever.  
It is not possible to wash them away from your heart.

Time was more important than anything else in my life.  
And Mir, I wasted my time foolishly.
