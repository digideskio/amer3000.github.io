It was a good book. As a math geek, I knew most of concept or theories presented in book but never applied those concepts in real life. It def. changed my views on many subjects in life.
Some parts of book were too boring. I had to struggle to keep reading a few pages. Don't get me wrong explaining a math formula in plain English is no easy task. But I would have loved to see a formula written in one line, instead of reading a paragraph.
I loved the first &amp; the last chapters. This book will help you realize that most things in life are not what they seem. Success has a lot to do with luck. Yes hard work is important but so does the factors beyond our control. Basically if you want to succeed, you have to be ready for many failures.
My favorite quote from the book was by Thomas Watson, "If you want to succeed, you have to double your failure rate."
