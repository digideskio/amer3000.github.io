In this hot desert heat  
you were a cool breeze

gone in a moment just as you came  
left me behind to wonder if you will ever return

to mess up my hair  
to touch my thirsty lips softly

you were a sweet dream  
vanished with the stars in the morning

leaving me to wake up in the blinding sunlight  
to look for a shade where there are no trees

you were a beautiful song  
which I cannot hear anymore in this noise

I tried dancing to you  
but there was no floor

a wish which cannot be fulfilled, a desire which will never die  
my hope was in vain but I held on to it.

you were a magic happened in a blink of an eye  
just as a shooting star disappears in the night sky

you were a poem written with an ink  
on paper left in the rain, washed away before I could read.
