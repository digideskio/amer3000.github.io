_[Mirza Ghalib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Ghalib) was the one of greatest poet in the Indian history. I translated this back in my college days._


I look at the joys of the world, as I look at the dust.
Crying used to give me peace but now even my eyes have run dried.

When I am dead, wind might take my dust to my destination.
Because now I have no more willpower to keep going.

For whom are these preparations of welcome, who is this lover from the heaven?
All I see is flowers, and nothing else.

My love has left me capable of nothing.
Now I just wish to live quietly somewhere.

Asad, my poetry is for times past.
It is useless to write, when no one understands.
