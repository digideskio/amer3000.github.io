*This is one of my favorite poem. It was written in Urdu. I translated it for my English class in college.*


O my friend, a heart needs no hate.  
Everyone loves good but do not even hate bad.

Who does not want the softness of flowers?  
But do not be afraid of sharpness of thorns.

There is same blood in the veins of the thorn.  
It is brought up by same evening breeze of the spring.

*

Do not throw away dying flowers.  
Yesterday, they were the beauties of the garden.

Once they were also part of the world of scents.  
O passerby! Do not kick dust on their leaves.

Though they are no longer in the party.  
They were raised in the laps of the morning breeze.

*

Living or not living, all are basically one.  
Earth and heavens, both were made from one.

There are millions of idol, but God is one.  
All hearts are different, but feeling is one.

They sell same clothes, but shops are different.  
The meanings are the same, but the languages are different.

*

The lightkeeper is also human.  
And the one who is lost in the dark sea is also human.

The best friend is also human.  
And the worst enemy is also human.

It doesnâ€™t matter if you run away from death or life.  
But, O Human! Never run away from humans.
