Just read Malcolm Gladwell's article on Nasim Taleb in **[What the Dog Saw](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316075841)**.

It basically talked about 2 different investing strategies &amp; psychology behind them. Most people prefer to win a little everyday even if their investing strategy exposes them to lose everything in a day.
Nasim Taleb has figured out how to make money by losing a little everyday but making a fortunate in a day. He is basically making a bet on the world being a lot more unpredictable than predictable.
