This is an old school project. I translated one of my favorite poem from Urdu.

**Poem by [Mir Dard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khwaja_Mir_Dard)**


It was a school or temple, or was it Makkah or a church.  
We were all guests, only you were the host.

Oh! How sad it is. I found just before death.  
It was only a dream, what I saw. It was only a fairy tale, what I heard.

How sad it is that autumn is in the garden.   
There was some grass, which was my friend.

This place is getting chaotic with all these people coming and going.    
My heart used to be the place for your peace.

It is useless to remember them, try to be happy.  
Dard, it is not important if they remember me or not.
