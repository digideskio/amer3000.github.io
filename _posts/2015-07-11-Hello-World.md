title: Hello World!

I switched from WordPress to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)/[Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). I was really happy with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and highly recommend it. 

But as a programmer, Github &amp; [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is closer to my daily workflow. And some of the features in WordPress are a bit too much for a personal blog. I needed something simple that is mostly focused on writing. My text editor with git seems like the simplest possible solution.
