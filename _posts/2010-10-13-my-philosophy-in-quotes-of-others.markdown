"Living or not living, all are basically one.
Earth and heavens, both were made from one.
There are millions of idols, but God is one.
All hearts are different, but feeling is one.
They sell same clothes, but shops are different.
The meanings are the same, but the languages are different".

- [Josh Mail Abadi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Malihabadi)

"While I was fighting, I heard other people speaking in the name of freedom, and the more they defended this unique right, the more enslaved they seemed to be to their parents’ wishes, to a marriage in which they had promised to stay with the other person “for the rest of their lives,” to the bathroom scales, to their diet, to half-finished projects, to lovers to whom they were incapable of saying “No” or “It’s over,” to weekends when they were obliged to have lunch with people they didn’t even like. Slaves to luxury, to the appearance of luxury, to the appearance of the appearance of luxury. Slaves to a life they had not chosen, but which they had decided to live because someone had managed to convince them that it was all for the best."

- Narrator in [The Zahir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Zahir_(novel)) by [Paulo Coelho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Coelho)

Know thyself so complete,  
that before every fate,  
God himself asks his slave,  
tell me what your will is  

- [Allama Iqbal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal)

If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.

Fish see the bait, but not the hook; men see the profit, but not the peril.

- Chinese proverb

Education rears disciples, imitators, and routinists, not pioneers of new ideas and creative geniuses. The schools are not nurseries of progress and improvement, but conservatories of tradition and unvarying modes of thought.

- [Ludwig von Mises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises)

the only way to truly conquer something, as every great philosopher and geneticist will tell you, is to love it.

"If you do something once, it's okay. Second time, when you do it, is maybe okay but third time is a major sin &amp; unforgivable."
